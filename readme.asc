This repo contains some notes on my AsciiDoc setup.
****************************************************************************


== Rendering
I am using the http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] engine to render my documents. Just found it easier to install. It is also better documented and much faster.



== Text editor
I am using Submlime text with the https://github.com/SublimeText/AsciiDoc[AsciiDoc plugin]

Create a new file, save it as `<filename>.asc`



== Syntax highlighting
Because I am using the AsciiDoctor engine, which is written in Ruby, I installed the https://rubygems.org/gems/pygments.rb[pygments.rb] package.

Use the `:source-highlighter: pygments` snippet at the top of the document to enable.



== Live rendering
I am using the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia?hl=en[Chrome plugin] for live rendering. 

In the settings set `safe mode` to `server` to ensure external files are linked.
